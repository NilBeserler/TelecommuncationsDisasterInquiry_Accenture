The goal of the project is to utilize unsupervised learning techniques to analyze and predict the impact of natural disasters on cellular towers throughout the United States. By identifying useful clusters within the data, the project aims to create estimations that can be visualized to uncover critical insights. These insights will enable the telecommunications client to make informed decisions about disaster preparedness and infrastructure resilience to mitigate the effects of natural disasters on their network.
